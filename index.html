        <a href="#"> Pyramidal cells in the mouse and ferret visual cortex are already orientation-selective at and before eye opening. Neurons in the developing brain become precisely connected before sensory organs mature. ProBDNF is more prevalent than BDNF during early development, but MMP9 controls relative amounts of pro BDNF and BDNF at a given synapse in an activity-dependent manner. We build a biophysically inspired model of synaptic plasticity based on the molecular mechanism of interacting neurotrophins required for synaptic clustering during development.</a>

                          <li>Since neurotrophins, calcium, and MMP9 have been implicated in the emergence of functional synaptic clustering during development we based our model for clustering on interactions between these molecules, although additional signaling pathways are likely to be involved in synaptic organization. A generalization of this model that derives directly from neurotrophin interactions can be flexibly implemented to apply to other signaling molecules. Possible alternative mechanisms include synaptic tag-and-capture, where plasticity-related-proteins mediate activity-dependent cooperation and competition, synaptic crosstalk through the interaction of Rho-family GTPase-mediated proteins, which are in fact modulated by BDNF and involved in structural plasticity, or the NMDAR-mediated amplification of calcium signals. For the local heterosynaptic depression of unstimulated synapses, alternatives to the neurotrophin mechanism include the activation of calcineurin, IP3Rs, and group I mGluRs or Arc-targeting of inactive synapses. Similarly, the functional roles of MMP9 and calcium could equivalently be filled by postsynaptic depolarization, NMDAR activation, endocannabinoid or nitric oxide signaling, or by more complex diffusible plasticity-related products. Thus, our predictions regarding the organization of synapses are not contingent on a specific biophysical implementation of our model, as long as it implements distance- and timing-dependent competition between synapses, and integrates slow developmental activity patterns matched to the timescales of plasticity.</li>

                              <li>We propose three situations where synaptic input clustering may be beneficial for a neuron. (1) The transient, precise synchronization of even a small group of synapses (the exact number of synapses required in vivo is unknown) can result in the nonlinear summation of synaptic activity, enhancing a neuron’s computational capacity. These nonlinearities can furthermore counteract location-dependent gradients of conductances across synapses, effectively establishing a synaptic democracy. (2) Since synaptic transmission is highly variable, multiple synapses encoding a similar signal (in combination with local supralinear integration) increase tolerance for different types of noise, some of which cannot be removed by averaging. (3) Furthermore, since the translation of proteins is localized to individual dendritic compartments where nearby synapses share available proteins, synaptic clustering is also beneficial from the perspective of resource-preservation, consistent with the sharing of plasticity-related proteins in models like synaptic tag-and-capture.</li>

                                  <li>Several factors make our model appropriate for the establishment of synaptic organization in development: the high turnover of synapses, the ability of synaptic inputs to interact over long distances, and the slow timescale of spontaneous activity and neurotrophin interactions. Therefore, in this developmental setting, STDP rules that operate on fast timescales involving several milliseconds do not generate clustering (Supplementary Fig. 5), in agreement with other studies of developmental plasticity. While early development is a particularly opportune time for the emergence of synaptic organization, it is currently unknown how clusters formed during development relate to those observed in the adult animal. Given the continued turnover of synapses in the adult brain and the formation of new clusters following altered sensory experience and learning, it is a priori unclear whether the clusters formed during early development persist into adulthood. Our developmentally inspired model for synaptic competition combined with correlated activity from retinal waves is sufficient to produce functional and feature-specific clustering as in the adult and can provide a backbone for clustering even when the density of synapses increases dramatically. Already-established clusters in our model can be preserved by decreasing the postsynaptic spread in calcium (Supplementary Fig. ), although other changes (such as the onset of inhibition, postsynaptic thresholding through a nonlinearity, or a decrease in proBDNF level) would be equally suited. This supports an interpretation where development equips dendrites with basic building blocks such as feature selectivity from which other functional properties are derived in adulthood. It would be interesting to investigate whether context-specific clustering as in the retrosplenial or the motor cortex occur alongside (rather than in competition with) clusters formed during development, as described in the auditory system of the juvenile barnowl, and how our proposed plasticity mechanism might interact with STDP rules relevant in the adult.</li>

                                <a href="#"> Our model focused on the emergence of fine-scale organization of excitatory (glutamatergic) inputs. We speculate that inhibitory (GABAergic) synapses might shape the clustering of exciteatory synapses. While not being clustered themselves, GABAergic synapses can constrain the orientation preference of nearby clusters in our model.</a>

                                  <li>Our modeling framework focused on the emergence of fine-scale organization of excitatory (glutamatergic) inputs, primarily due to lack of experimental data on the role of inhibitory (GABAergic) synapses on clustering. We speculate, however, that inhibitory synapses might shape the clustering of excitatory synapses on the dendritic tree. Indeed, while not being clustered themselves, GABAergic synapses can constrain the orientation preference of nearby excitatory clusters in our model (Supplementary Fig. ). Since GABA might be excitatory early in postnatal development, we considered two scenarios in our model with GABA switching from excitatory to inhibitory or being inhibitory the entire time. The resulting excitatory clusters are tuned to the same orientation relative to nearby inhibitory synapses in the former case or tend to prefer the orthogonal orientation in the latter case (Supplementary Fig. ). Thus, we predict that GABAergic synapses might be co-clustered with excitatory synapses. Provided that GABAergic synapses fire in synchrony with glutamatergic synapses, this co-clustering could allow them to dynamically switch a given cluster on or off. Additionally, since inhibitory synapses can cancel the effect of backpropagating action potentials, we expect that inhibitory synapses synchronized with somatic activation would be able to protect a cluster from the homogenizing effect of backpropagating somatic signals.</li>

An alternative normative approach proposed the generation of synaptic clusters as the Bayes-optimal solution to a classical conditioning task with unreliable synaptic transmission.

                                  <li>Dendritic compartmentalization of synaptic inputs achieved by clustering has been postulated to enhance the computational capacity of neurons. Yet, direct experimental evidence of clustering during development, and with respect to different stimulus features in different species in the adult, has only recently emerged. At the same time, recent work has revealed disparate results regarding the global order of synaptic inputs on the entire dendritic tree. To reconcile these findings, we developed a computational framework supported by a specific biophysical implementation based on neurotrophins for the emergence of both local and global synaptic input organization on cortical dendrites in two different species. Combining developmentally inspired synaptic plasticity with retinal wave input and species-specific features of synaptic receptive fields, our framework supports the establishment of local functional clustering for orientation in the adult ferret vs. receptive field overlap in the adult mouse visual cortex. Including an attenuating somatic signal generates global organization of different features in the ferret and mouse cortex, establishing soma-to-dendrite maps of orientation selectivity and visual topography, respectively. We found that the interaction between two parameters, the cortical magnification factor of visual space and the receptive field diameter, drives these species-specific differences. Interestingly, these parameters can also explain the population-level (columnar vs. salt-and-pepper) organization in the ferret vs. mouse visual cortex, indicating that the same universal developmental process modulated by variations of cortex and retina size can produce both dendritic and population-level organization.</li>

                <a href="#"> In mouse visual cortex, pyramidal neurons have a tendency to respond to more central vs. peripheral regions of visual space relative to the somatic receptive field center, 0.0.0. This result is in contrast to the ferret where a bAP does not generate a dendritic map. We simulated retinal waves and converted them to cortical synaptic input via a two-stage linear-nonlinear (LN) model. In the LN model, a synapse probabilistically receives bursts of action potentials when the Gabor filter is stimulated by a retinal wave traveling in the direction that matches the filter orientation (Fig. 3a) We found that all nearby synapses in the stable state share similarly oriented receptive fields.</a>

                          <li>Indeed, in pyramidal neurons of the mouse visual cortex, proximal vs. distal synapses respectively have a tendency to respond to more central vs. peripheral regions of visual space relative to the somatic receptive field center,0. This result is in contrast to the ferret; also in our model, a bAP does not generate a dendritic map of visual space (Fig. 5g) because receptive fields of synaptic inputs proximal to the soma already overlap significantly due to their similar orientation preference to the soma. Hence, shifting their centers toward the somatic center does not increase their overlap and correlation as much as changing their orientation preference (Fig. 4h). As a result of the global organization of receptive field overlap and dendritic maps generated in our model with bAPs of mouse visual cortex, synapses with nearby receptive field centers in visual space have a similarly oriented receptive field (Fig. 6d). We consequently observed that the distribution of receptive field orientations in different regions of visual space generated in the model has an interesting structure. In particular, synaptic receptive fields positioned along or close to the axis of the somatic receptive field, i.e., in the coaxial space, appear to have a similar orientation to the soma (Fig. 6e, left). This mirrors the distribution of circular dispersions in the coaxial region of visual space in the mouse visual cortex (Fig. 6f, left). The functionally specific organization in coaxial space agrees with the overrepresentation of edges with the same orientation along a common axis found in natural images called colinearity and could be used for the detection of elongated edges. Interestingly, in our model, synapses in the remaining region of visual space, called the orthogonal space, are more likely to be oriented orthogonally to the soma (Fig. 6e, right). This overrepresentation of large circular dispersions compared to experimental data (Fig. 6f, right) is, however, consistent with another property found in natural images, called cocircularity, where two segments with different orientation have a tendency to be tangent to the same circle, and which could be used for the detection of continuous and smooth object boundaries. We believe that the discrepancy between experiments and our model might stem from undersampling in the experiments or from additional pruning of connections between cells with large orientation differences after eye opening. These results suggest that, even before the onset of vision, spontaneous activity contains sufficient spatiotemporal information to organize synaptic receptive fields into the orthogonal and coaxial portions of visual space for the detection of elongated edges or continuous boundaries in natural images. This has strong implications for the computational strategies of these neurons and their integration into local microcircuits. Taken together, our model generates global, in addition to local, organization of synaptic inputs on the dendrites of cortical neurons in the mouse for different features than in the ferret by only including anatomical differences in their visual cortices in terms of the spread and diameter of synaptic receptive fields. In our framework, both the emergence of a retinotopic gradient along the dendritic tree, as well as the accumulation of co-aligned (orthogonally-oriented) synapses in the coaxial (orthogonal) portion of visual space, can be explained through the homogenizing influence of bAPs. Therefore, our model explains the emergence of synaptic organization across scales and in two different species with respect to different stimulus features.</li>

                        <a href="#"> We implemented our plasticity model on a morphologically realistic layer 2/3 pyramidal neuron. We modeled a somatic signal that affects the dendrite in the form of a backpropagating action potential (bAP) The bAP results in a calcium influx into the proximal and distal dendritic branches that attenuates with distance from the soma. Increasing bAP frequency controls the degree of homogeneity of the  proximal tree (Fig. 5f) Consistent with experimental reports, our model does not produce global organization of receptive field offsets, which are randomly distributed for synapses.</a>

Consistent with experimental reports, our model does not produce global organization of receptive field offsets, which are randomly distributed for synapses along the entire dendritic tree (Fig. 5g and Supplementary Fig. 9). Different degrees of heterogeneity of synaptic orientation preference have been reported in the ferret visual cortex, where experiments distinguished between homogeneous branches, with a mean circular dispersion below °, and heterogeneous branches, with a mean circular dispersion above °. We compared the cumulative distribution functions of the homogeneous and the heterogeneous branches to proximal (less than two times the attenuation factor) and distal (more than two times the attenuation factor) synapses in our model, respectively, and found good quantitative agreement (Fig. 5h). Computing the distribution of circular dispersions of spines on branches with mean circular dispersion between ° and ° in our model revealed branches with intermediate heterogeneity (Fig. 5i). While from the experiments it is not clear whether homogeneous (heterogeneous) branches tend to be more proximal (distal) to the soma, our results predict the global organization of orientation selectivity and suggest that bAP attenuation in different neurons may underlie branch orientation heterogeneity. In summary, the same modeling framework that produces local orientation clustering of synaptic inputs predicts global synaptic organization on a morphologically realistic model of a layer 2/3 pyramidal neuron with synapses on proximal dendrites sharing similar orientation preference with the soma. We suggest that an attenuating somatic signal is the main factor behind homogenizing some branches of the tree to the same orientation preference as the soma while leaving other branches more heterogeneous and uncorrelated to the soma as observed in the ferret visual cortex.</li>

                                  <li>We next asked whether the local organization of synaptic inputs achieved by our model also supports the emergence of global organization of synaptic inputs on the dendritic tree. To probe interactions between the soma and synapses on different dendritic branches in a biologically realistic framework beyond the linear dendrites considered so far, we implemented our plasticity model on a morphologically realistic layer 2/3 pyramidal neuron (Fig. 5a). We modeled a somatic signal that affects the dendrite in the form of a backpropagating action potential (bAP) whenever the linearly summed input over all synapses exceeds a fixed threshold. The bAP results in a calcium influx into the proximal and distal dendritic branches that attenuates with distance from the soma (Fig. 5b, c). As a result, the calcium signal at proximal synapses in our model neuron is dominated by somatic activity, while distal synapses are almost independent of the soma (Fig. 5c) as found experimentally. Since bAPs are known to induce the release of neurotrophins, we investigated how an attenuating bAP affects the correlation- and distance-dependent competition when implementing the full complement of neurotrophin interactions. We found that a bAP naturally extends both mechanisms over larger spatial scales, so that synapses near the soma experience stronger depression than those farther away from the soma when they are activated asynchronously to the soma, and stronger potentiation when activated in synchrony with the soma (Supplementary Fig. 8). Therefore, the addition of a bAP should not affect local synaptic organization on branches far away from the soma, but reinforce it near the soma. Using a small receptive field diameter and center spread for the ferret visual cortex, our model generates local orientation clusters along the entire dendritic tree just like on the linear dendrite (Fig. 5d, e and Supplementary Fig. 9). By including bAPs, global organization on the entire dendritic tree also emerges. Synaptic inputs on proximal dendritic branches acquire orientation preferences similar to the soma due to the weak decay of bAP signaling, while inputs on distal dendrites have orientation preferences that are independent of the soma due to the strong bAP attenuation (Fig. 5e). Therefore, including bAPs homogenizes proximal dendritic branches to the orientation preference of the soma while leaving distal synapses unconstrained (Fig. 5e, inset), and hence variable across individual simulations (Supplementary Fig. 9). We characterized the degree of branch heterogeneity by computing the circular dispersion, i.e., the difference between the orientation preference of individual synapses and the soma (Fig. 5d and Methods).</li>

Synaptic inputs on the reconstructed pyramidal neuron do not exhibit local orientation clustering, nor global homogenization of orientation preference except for a small bias, as observed experimentally, (Fig. 6b and Supplementary Fig. 9). Synaptic inputs, however, do exhibit local overlap clustering as without a bAP, as well as global organization on the dendritic tree in the presence of a bAP, with synapses close to the soma having overlapping receptive fields with many other synapses close to the soma (Supplementary Fig. 9). As expected from the role of bAPs in reinforcing potentiation and depression near the soma (Supplementary Fig. 8), bAPs homogenize receptive field overlap close to the soma where the bAP influence is the strongest. In the presence of a bAP, proximal synapses stabilize only if their receptive fields overlap with the somatic receptive field constraining their resulting receptive field offset to be small. Hence, the bAP brings receptive fields of proximal synapses to be on average centered closer to the somatic receptive field compared to the receptive fields of distal synapses (Fig. 6a, c). Distal synapses do not have this constraint, resulting in large cell-to-cell variability at distal branches (Supplementary Fig. 9). This relationship is modulated by bAP attenuation, with weak attenuation increasing the number of synapses centered near the somatic receptive field (Fig. 6c). We refer to this global organization as a dendritic map of visual space.</li>

                          <li>We next tested the potential of the above-developed model inspired by neurotrophin interactions to organize synaptic inputs in the developing visual cortex driven by spontaneous activity propagated from the sensory periphery. We simulated retinal waves and converted them to cortical synaptic input via a two-stage linear-nonlinear (LN) model (Fig. 3a and Methods). For the linear filter we used a spatially oriented Gabor with positive and negative elongated subregions based on receptive field measurements of individual spines on pyramidal neurons in the adult mouse visual cortex. Each Gabor receptive field is characterized by three parameters: center, described in polar coordinates, diameter, and orientation, with a value between 0° and 0° (Fig. 3a). We inferred the receptive field diameter and center distribution for the visual cortex of two species, mouse and ferret (see Methods). An exponential nonlinearity converts the linearly filtered retinal waves into instantaneous firing rates from which activity is generated via a Poisson process (see Methods). Thus, in the LN model, a synapse probabilistically receives bursts of action potentials when the Gabor filter is stimulated by a retinal wave traveling in the direction that matches the filter orientation (Fig. 3a). Since activation of a synapse depends on the appropriate stimulation of its associated receptive field, synapses with nearby receptive field centers in visual space and a small difference in orientation experience correlated input (Fig. 3b). White noise stimulation does not produce correlations for any orientation difference due to the lack of spatiotemporal structure to consistently activate nearby receptive fields (Fig. 3b). Using a receptive field diameter and a center distribution from the ferret visual cortex, we placed synaptic inputs with randomly oriented receptive fields on a non-branching, linear dendrite—as a model of small, approximately linear portions of real dendritic trees —and stimulated them with retinal waves filtered through an LN model. Neighboring synapses with mismatched orientations receive uncorrelated input as they are rarely activated by the same retinal wave and consequently depress. To prevent their irrevocable elimination, we modeled an activity-dependent mechanism of structural plasticity, which preserves the total number of synaptic inputs on a dendritic branch, (Fig. 3c). Upon the removal of a synapse, a new synapse is placed at a random position on the dendritic branch with a randomly oriented receptive field and center in visual space sampled from the experimentally measured distribution in the ferret visual cortex (see Methods). Throughout the simulation, synapses compete and are either stabilized or eliminated and turned over until nearby synapses share a similarly oriented receptive field (Fig. 3d). The number of turnovers per day decreases rapidly, with all remaining turnovers due to a small fraction of synapses (Fig. 3e). Despite substantial turnover during the first three days of the simulation, ~% of synapses present at the beginning of the simulation do not experience any turnover and form a scaffold around which the remaining synapses stabilize (Fig. 3e, inset). Synapses that do not experience any turnover throughout the entire simulation tend to have a smaller-than-chance orientation difference from each other. We found that all nearby synapses in the stable state share similarly oriented receptive fields, a type of clustering that we call orientation clustering (Fig. 3d right, f).</li>

                              <li>Orientation clustering has been found in layer 2/3 of the adult ferret visual cortex in vivo. This orientation clustering further generates functional synaptic clustering in our simulations, where correlations between pairs of synapses trained with retinal wave input decay with distance at the same rate as during spontaneous activity in layer 2/3 of the adult ferret visual cortex (Fig. 3g). When using this relationship to characterize the size of the formed clusters, we found that cluster size strongly depends on the spatial spread constant of postsynaptic calcium (Fig. 3h and Supplementary Fig. 4). Therefore, we suggest that the different sizes of orientation clusters found in different species, variability across different cells of the same animal, as well as potential differences in development vs. adulthood, could be the result of different amounts of postsynaptic calcium spread. Orientation clustering also emerges when we implement the full complement of neurotrophin interactions in our model (Supplementary Fig. 2). While we do not know whether neurotrophins directly drive the orientation clustering observed in the adult brain, our results show that slow developmental timescales of plasticity and input correlations together with timing- and distance-dependent synaptic competition are sufficient. Orientation and functional clustering do not emerge with white noise stimulation (Fig. 3f), nor with a spike-timing-based plasticity (STDP) rule that induces synaptic change based on precise spike timing (Supplementary Fig. 5), due to the mismatch of timescales between the input patterns and the induction of plasticity. Including a dendritic nonlinearity preserves clustering and decreases the average nearest neighbor distance (Supplementary Fig. 6). Similarly, when requiring the synchronous activation of multiple neighboring synapses for the induction of plasticity, clustering persists when the timing and spacing thresholds for such cooperative plasticity are consistently satisfied by the developmental slow timescales of activity and low synaptic density (Supplementary Fig. 6). Otherwise, clustering is remarkably stable against perturbations of most model parameters (Supplementary Fig. 1). Clustering is, however, sensitive to changes in the heterosynaptic offset, which can shift plasticity into an exclusively potentiating or depressing regime (Supplementary Fig. 1). Since our model is based on neurotrophin interactions, we can interpret perturbations to the heterosynaptic offset as perturbations in the balance between BDNF and proBDNF signaling (Supplementary Fig. 3). For instance, exogenous application of either proBDNF or BDNF can abolish clustering in vitro within minutes. Our model also makes predictions for how additional perturbations to the conversion between the two neurotrophins, or the receptors to which they bind, might affect synaptic efficacy and clustering (Supplementary Fig. 3). In summary, with a synaptic receptive field diameter and a center distribution from the ferret visual cortex, our model generates local clusters of similarly oriented and, therefore, functionally correlated synaptic inputs on a dendritic branch based on correlated input from retinal waves. Therefore, a neurotrophin-inspired model for clustering supports the emergence of local synaptic organization in the ferret cortex.</li>

                              <li>In contrast to the ferret, nearby synapses on pyramidal neuron dendrites in the mature mouse visual cortex do not share a preference for the same orientation. However, nearby synapses in the mouse visual cortex still exhibit correlated activity during development, and hence are functionally clustered. We next investigated whether our modeling framework can also generate the functional clustering observed in the mouse. One striking difference between mouse and ferret is the size of their retina and visual cortex, with each being about two vs. five times smaller in the mouse than in the ferret, respectively (Fig. 4a). Consequently, the average receptive field diameter in the mouse visual cortex is about twice as large, and the cortical magnification of visual space about five times smaller than in the ferret (Fig. 4b, c). Consistent with these anatomical differences, a pyramidal neuron in the mouse visual cortex receives inputs from a considerably larger region of visual space than in the ferret (Fig. 4c, middle). The difference in the sampled region of visual space can be captured by the relative broadness of the distribution of receptive field centers characterized experimentally in the two species, a parameter that we call the receptive field center spread (Fig. 4c, right). We implemented our neurotrophin-inspired model for clustering using a larger receptive field diameter and center spread as measured in the mouse visual cortex to determine the synaptic organization driven by retinal waves (Fig. 4d). We observed functional synaptic clustering during spontaneous activity, as measured during development (Fig. 4e). Interestingly, this functional organization is the result of synaptic clustering for receptive field overlap, rather than orientation (Fig. 4d–g). Such clustering of synapses with overlapping receptive fields is consistent with recent measurements in the adult mouse visual cortex. We refer to this type of clustering as overlap clustering to contrast it with the orientation clustering observed in the ferret. Adding irregularities to the Gabor synaptic filters further improves the match between model and data (Supplementary Fig. 7). To understand the principal factors that determine the type of clustering, we computed the correlations of synaptic activity resulting from the overlap of simulated synaptic receptive fields—that are either orientation clustered or overlap clustered—upon perturbing the spread of their centers on the dendritic branch (Fig. 4h). The orientation clustered receptive fields produce the highest correlations when the receptive field center spread is small (~5°, as in the ferret). With increasing spread, the overlap between the positive and negative components of the Gabor filter increases, which decreases correlations (Fig. 4h; green). Conversely, the receptive fields clustered by overlap produce the highest correlations when receptive field center spread is larger (~–°, as in the mouse) (Fig. 4h; purple). Next, we determined the prevalence of orientation vs. overlap clustering by simultaneously varying the two anatomical parameters, the center spread, and the diameter of Gabor receptive fields in the visual cortex, and without modeling other differences in morphology, dendritic arborization, or synaptic density (Fig. 4i). Interestingly, for a very small receptive field diameter, only small receptive field center spread yields orientation clustering in our framework. Consistent with this, in the macaque visual cortex, which has a small receptive field diameter and receptive field center spread, orientation clustering has recently been reported. Therefore, our model explains the emergence of synaptic clustering with respect to different stimulus features in the mouse and ferret. Without modeling other differences in the visual systems, we find that clustering emerges from maximizing the amount of correlation as a function of the geometric arrangement of synaptic receptive fields in the different species (Fig. 4j).</li>

                          <li>To identify the driving factors for fine-scale dendritic organization of synaptic inputs, we formulated a computational model based on a local molecular mechanism implicated in the emergence of clustering during development. The mechanism implements an activity-dependent interaction between two signaling molecules: proBDNF and BDNF, and the conversion factor between them, MMP9 (Fig. 1a and Methods). Upon activation, a synapse in our model evokes the postsynaptic release of proBDNF and BDNF through the opening of voltage-gated calcium channels and the subsequent influx of calcium, which spreads postsynaptically in the developing brain. Through the lateral spread of calcium, the activated synapse can exert a direct effect on a different nearby synapse by triggering neurotrophin release independent of presynaptic stimulation of that synapse. MMP9 release is also coupled to neural activity, but instead of spreading postsynaptically, it is co-localized with glutamatergic receptors in excitatory synapses. Therefore, we modeled MMP9 and calcium as synapse-specific and shared accumulators of neural activity, respectively (see Methods). Analyzing the molecular interactions in the neurotrophin model revealed two prominent properties for sorting dendritic synaptic inputs into local clusters: timing-dependent cooperation and distance-dependent competition. Distance-dependent competition arises when considering the plasticity of two nearby synaptic inputs as a function of the distance between them and the stimulation frequency upon stimulating one of them (Fig. 1b–d). Driving one synapse with bursts, the units of information transmission during development, shifts the balance between proBDNF and BDNF in favor of BDNF due to the activity-dependent release of MMP9 (Fig. 1b, c). Thus, the stimulated synapse potentiates. In contrast, the unstimulated synapse depresses by an amount depending on the distance between synapses, as it remains dominated by proBDNF due to the absence of MMP9 (Fig. 1d and Methods). Plasticity of an unstimulated synapse following the stimulation of another synapse is called heterosynaptic and can stabilize the positive feedback of Hebbian plasticity. In addition to this distance-dependent heterosynaptic depression, the neurotrophin model exhibits timing-dependent cooperation by potentiating nearby coactive synapses. This can be best seen when implementing a classical plasticity induction paradigm where we quantified synaptic strength as a function of the timing between pre- and postsynaptic events (Fig. 1e). Using bursts as the natural activity patterns in development, we found that pre- and postsynaptic bursts with temporal offsets below 1 s yield synaptic potentiation due to the relative dominance of BDNF over proBDNF-induced signaling, while longer offsets lead to depression (Fig. 1f, g). This type of plasticity in the neurotrophin model can be matched to a timing-dependent Hebbian learning rule described in the developing visual system, burst-timing-dependent plasticity (BTDP). According to this rule, synaptic change is sensitive to the overlap between pre- and postsynaptic bursts on the timescale of several hundred milliseconds. Remarkably, the dependence of the neurotrophin model on burst-timing as in the BTDP rule is robust to perturbations in most parameters of the model except for the proBDNF/BDNF ratio, which can shift the BTDP curve into depression and eliminate synaptic competition (Supplementary Fig. 1). In summary, the proposed neurotrophin model provides a mechanistic implementation for (1) the distance-dependent competition between differentially stimulated synapses and (2) the timing-dependent potentiation when pre- and postsynaptic activity overlap over developmentally relevant timescales of several hundred milliseconds. Identifying these two ingredients provides a key step towards a general framework for establishing synaptic organization in development, and reconciling different aspects of synaptic organization observed in the adult.</li>

                              <li>To establish a framework for synaptic organization, we generalized the neurotrophin model to a local dendritic learning rule independent from a specific biophysical implementation. The generalized model derives directly from neurotrophin interactions, and hence retains the two key properties of timing- and distance-dependent plasticity (Supplementary Fig. 2). Synaptic efficacy change depends on the accumulated presynaptic (pre) and postsynaptic (post) activity and a constant heterosynaptic offset related to the initial ratio of proBDNF to BDNF in the absence of extracellular conversion through MMP9 (see Methods), This generalized neurotrophin-inspired model has the advantage that it can be analyzed mathematically, can be flexibly implemented to apply to other signaling molecules, and hence, a broader cast of synaptic organization scenarios. This is especially important since the role of neurotrophins in the emergence of clustering of different stimulus features, as well as their interaction with plasticity-related proteins involved in tag-and-capture and synaptic crosstalk, in adulthood, is unknown. To determine how distance- and timing-dependent plasticity might drive the emergence of synaptic organization with respect to different stimulus features, we next investigated the consequences of these two model characteristics on the organization of multiple randomly distributed synaptic inputs on a linear dendritic branch. Under the assumption that synaptic efficacy changes on a much slower timescale than neural activity, the average change in synaptic efficacy can be expressed as a function of the synaptic input correlation (Eq.  in Methods). Therefore, the timing-dependent plasticity of synaptic inputs represented by the BTDP rule in our model translates into local plasticity that depends on input correlations. To investigate distance-dependent competition of multiple randomly distributed synaptic inputs on a dendritic branch, we varied the synaptic density. Locally, low synaptic density implies that pairs of synaptic inputs are on average far away from each other, while high synaptic density implies that pairs of synaptic inputs are on average near each other. Hence, local density relates to synaptic distance. We derived the average change in synaptic efficacy as a function of two parameters: the input correlation and the synaptic density on the dendritic branch (Fig. 2a, b and Supplementary Fig. 2). We identified three regimes: (i) at any synaptic density, if the synaptic input correlation is higher than a critical amount (Methods) then synapses stabilize (Fig. 2c, diamond), (ii) at low synaptic density, if the input correlation is lower than the same critical amount then synapses also stabilize (Fig. 2c, star), and (iii) at high synaptic density, if the input correlation is lower than the critical amount then synapses compete (Fig. 2c, triangle). Note that in regime (iii), synapses compete until a random subset is silenced, which reduces the effective density of the remaining synapses and eventually stabilizes them (Fig. 2b).</li>

                              <li>The proposed generalization of the neurotrophin model thus implements Hebbian correlation-based plasticity at the single synapse where synaptic efficacy is modulated by the local density of synaptic inputs on the dendrite, just like the implementation with interacting neurotrophins (Supplementary Fig. 2). The generalized neurotrophin-inspired model for clustering enabled us to dissect how specific neurotrophin interactions influence the functional dependence of synaptic efficacy on input correlation and synaptic density. In particular, it is well established that BDNF can increase, while proBDNF can decrease the synaptic density on developing dendrites. Applying those same perturbations to our model produces similar neurotrophin-induced changes in synaptic density, since the ratio of BDNF to proBDNF determines the synaptic density at which potentiation and depression are balanced through the heterosynaptic offset (Supplementary Fig. 3). Additionally, the generalized model remains relevant for the emergence of synaptic organization in development. Key properties that are accounted for are the slow timescales of the pre- and postsynaptic accumulators that respectively correspond to the time constants of MMP9 and postsynaptic calcium and give rise to the developmental BTDP plasticity rule (Supplementary Fig. 2). Additionally, the model implements the lateral postsynaptic spread of calcium, consistent with developmentally prevalent shaft synapses which can interact over long distances more easily than adult spine synapses. As a result, the synaptic competition in our model (Fig. 2b, c) resembles a local out-of-sync-lose-your-link plasticity rule underlying the emergence of clustering in the developing visual cortex and hippocampus. According to this rule, synaptic inputs on developing pyramidal dendrites either increase or decrease the success rate of synaptic transmission depending on their synchrony with their nearby, but not distant, neighbors (Fig. 2d, left). To directly compare our model to this experimental data, we visualized the synaptic efficacy as a measure of synaptic transmission success at two different densities (Fig. 2b): a high density of 0.5 μm−1 (a synapse every 2 μm), which corresponds to local synapses in the data (&lt; μm), and a low density of 0. μm−1 (a synapse every  μm), which corresponds to distant synapses in the data (– μm). Our model generates a similar out-of-sync-lose-your-link rule where local synaptic inputs (high density) are depressed if weakly correlated and potentiated if strongly correlated. In contrast, distant synaptic inputs (low density) are stabilized independent of correlation (Fig. 2d, right). A similar out-of-sync-lose-your-link structural plasticity, without the local postsynaptic component, has also been studied previously to solve more abstract classification tasks. Taken together, our generalized model based on neurotrophin interactions with properties of timing- and distance-dependent competition provides a general framework to study the emergence of synaptic organization on dendritic branches innervated by multiple synaptic inputs. The model relates synaptic efficacy change to synaptic input correlation and local density and can capture the depression of weakly correlated neighboring inputs embodying out-of-sync-lose-your-link plasticity, implicated in the emergence of functional synaptic clustering during development.</li>

By binding to their corresponding receptors, BDNF and proBDNF can respectively promote synaptic potentiation and the survival of neurons, and synaptic depression and the apoptosis of axons and neurons. While proBDNF is more prevalent than BDNF during early development, the protease matrix metallopeptidase  (MMP9) controls the relative amounts of proBDNF and BDNF at a given synapse in an activity-dependent manner, and therefore regulates the plasticity of that synapse. This sets up a promising mechanistic implementation for the developmental formation of synaptic clusters based on neurotrophin interactions, yet the key computational properties that lead to the activity-dependent cooperation and competition of multiple synapses innervating a dendritic branch are unknown.</li>

                          <li>Neurons in the developing brain become precisely connected before sensory organs mature. Spontaneous activity plays a major role in refining circuit connectivity to mature levels at the scale of single neurons and networks. During visual system development, for example, synaptic connections are established by matching molecular gradients and axonal targeting. Spatiotemporal correlations in spontaneous activity then instruct the development of various receptive field properties and visual feature maps, which are further fine-tuned by sensory activity. In addition to refining developing networks at cellular precision, spontaneous activity can also establish fine-scale organization of individual synapses within the dendritic arborizations of single neurons. One striking example of such fine-scale organization is functional synaptic clustering: synapses onto dendrites of pyramidal neurons that receive correlated input or encode a common sensory feature are spatially grouped. Synaptic clustering has been observed across brain regions, developmental ages, and diverse species from rodent to primate, and has multiple functional benefits; it compartmentalizes the dendrites of single neurons, enables supralinear integration of inputs, shapes memory formation, and can explain translation-invariance of complex cells in the visual cortex. However, the mechanistic origins of synaptic clustering dependent on spontaneous activity during early postnatal development, and its relation to functional organization in the adult, remain elusive.</li>

For example, dendritic branches in the ferret visual cortex exhibit local clustering of orientation selectivity but do not exhibit global organization of inputs according to spatial location and receptive field properties. In contrast, synaptic inputs in the mouse visual cortex do not cluster locally by orientation, but only by receptive field overlap, and exhibit a global retinotopic organization along the proximal-distal axis.
